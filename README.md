📊 Customer Behaviour Data Analytics Project – README
📌 Overview

This project analyzes customer behavior using Python, SQL, and Power BI to uncover insights such as purchase patterns, key customer segments, retention trends, and product performance.
It includes data loading, cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), SQL querying, dashboard creation, and reporting.

📂 Dataset

Format: CSV / Excel

Contains transaction-level customer data

Typical fields: CustomerID, Age, Gender, Product, Quantity, Amount, Date, City, etc.

Used for: EDA, feature engineering, SQL queries, and dashboard visualizations

🛠️ Tools & Technologies

Python: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib/Seaborn

SQL: PostgreSQL / MySQL / SQL Server

Power BI: Interactive dashboard

Gamma App: Automated PPT generation

Jupyter Notebook / VS Code: Development environment

🔍 Steps
1. Load the Dataset in Python

Import dataset using Pandas

Check data shape, missing values, and structure

2. Data Cleaning

Handle missing values

Remove duplicates

Convert datatypes (e.g., dates)

Feature engineering (e.g., total spend, recency, frequency)

3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Univariate & bivariate analysis

Trend visualizations (sales over time, customer distribution, product demand)

Correlation analysis

4. SQL Queries

Executed queries on PostgreSQL/MySQL/SQL Server to:

Filter customer segments

Aggregate sales

Identify high-value customers (RFM-based)

Analyze product performance

Generate monthly/quarterly insights

5. Power BI Dashboard

Created an interactive dashboard with:

Sales trends

Customer segments

Product category performance

Geographic insights

KPIs: AOV, retention, repeat purchases

6. Report Creation

Summary of findings

Key metrics

Actionable recommendations

7. PPT Using Gamma

Automated slide deck

Visual insights, charts, and conclusions

Clean, recruiter-ready presentation

📈 Dashboard Highlights

Dynamic slicers for customer demographics

Product-wise sales and revenue breakdown

Repeat purchase behavior insights

Interactive charts (line, bar, map, KPI cards)

🧠 Results & Key Insights

Identified top-performing customer segments

Observed retention trends and repeat purchase patterns

Highlighted high-value customers using RFM analysis

Revealed underperforming product categories

Created a data-backed approach for marketing and business decisions

▶️ How to Run
1. Python Script
pip install -r requirements.txt
python analysis.py

2. SQL

Import dataset.csv into your SQL database

Run queries from queries.sql

3. Power BI

Open dashboard.pbix

Refresh dataset connection

4. Gamma PPT

Open presentation.gslides (Gamma export)

Customize if needed# Customer_Behaviour_Analysis
Analysed customer transactions to identify buying patterns and key behavioural segments. Cleaned and transformed data using Python and SQL, and built an interactive Power BI dashboard to visualise KPIs such as AOV, retention, and repeat purchase trends.
